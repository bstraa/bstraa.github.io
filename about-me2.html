    <h3>Come back soon - will update shortly!</h3>
<h2><strong>The Blessing in Disguise</strong></h2>
<h4>It was 2014 and I had been playing poker professionally for quite some time.  This was years after <a href="http://www.cardplayer.com/poker-news/13127-black-friday-the-day-that-changed-online-poker">Black Friday</a>, and the games had gotten extemely challenging.  Everyone everywhere was looking for an edge and the game was growing increasingly conservative.</h4>
<h4>I knew many of the players I'd regularly play with - we'd dueled it out over the years and had a lot of mutual respect. We also had a mutual interest in keeping an eye out for suspicious players (I <em>guarantee</em> collusion and cheaters affected my bottom line much more than the poker site's).</h4>
<h4>Looking back, it was an interesting point in the history of poker because it prefaced <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2015/april/computer-faces-poker-pros.html">CMU's Poker Bot</a>.  You'll see how this connects later.</h4>
<h4>Over a couple weeks, I noticed some new players from the same location who'd been putting in some serious hours and doing quite well.  This was pretty rare - most players slowly move up in stakes and generally put in less time because they know it takes awhile to get accustomed to new players and higher stakes.</h4>
<h4>Furthermore, more players seemed to appear from the same location with an extremely similar playing style.  What was particularly alarming was they <em>never</em> played each other exclusively or together in games with very few players.</h4>
<h4>My intuition was definitely kicking in - alarm bells went off in my head.  I figured it'd be wise to take a closer look before I continued to play.  Although cheaters in the past were frequently caught (and players reimbursed), this seemed...<em>different</em>.</h4>
<h4>I had caught cheaters in the past, but they were fairly obvious about it.  It is much more suspicious for terrible players to win huge over time than it is for poker pros (losing professional poker players don't last long!).</h4>
<h4>Anyway, I did fairly extensive research into their statistics (I created a database with every statistic you could imagine).  My jaw dropped as I poured over the numbers - their statistics were <em>eerily</em> similar.  Granted, if there exists a game theory optimal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium">Nash Equilibrium</a> which all poker pros attained, this would be likely.</h4>
<h4>However, this was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha_hold_%27em#Pot-limit_Omaha">PLO</a> and is <em>extremely</em> far from being solved.  I decided to message the poker site and fellow players.  The poker site conducted a 'thorough investigation', but insisted players have similar statistics all the time.  I agreed, but insisted there is a significant difference between <em>nearly identical</em> and <em>similar</em>.  I provided other insights, but without quantitative proof I was shit out of luck.</h4>
<h4><em>to be continued...</em></h4>
